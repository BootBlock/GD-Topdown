# Topdown
 A multiplayer battle arena game written in Godot 4, with more of a focus on realism but not at the cost of fun.

 ## Why?
 So I can learn Godot. This project will be worked on on a "whenever" basis.

Note that this was started long before I really knew what I was doing in Godot, so I would change a lot about things now. I'll probably begin to convert stuff over if I get back into this at some point.

## Anything playable?
When the game progresses enough beyond its previous release, then a new release will be made.

The first release, though, will need to have something worth playing around with. So, not quite yet.
