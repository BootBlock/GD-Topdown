# Topdown
 A multiplayer battle arena game written in Godot 4.

 ## Why?
 So I can learn Godot. That's about it, really.

## Anything playable?
When the game progresses enough beyond its previous release, then a new release will be made.

The first release, though, will need to have something worth playing around with. So, not quite yet.
